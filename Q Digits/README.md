## Digits Problem Description

### Problem Statement
You are given a number \( N \). Your task is to print the digits of that number from right to left, separated by spaces.

### Input Format
- The first line contains an integer \( T \) (1 ≤ \( T \) ≤ 10), which represents the number of test cases.
- The next \( T \) lines each contain a single integer \( N \) (0 ≤ \( N \) ≤ \( 10^9 \)).

### Output Format
For each test case, print the digits of the number \( N \) from right to left, separated by spaces.

### Example

#### Input
```
4
121
39
123456
1200
```

#### Output
```
1 2 1
9 3
6 5 4 3 2 1
0 0 2 1
```

### Explanation
For each number:
- 121: The digits are 1, 2, and 1. When reversed, it becomes "1 2 1".
- 39: The digits are 3 and 9. When reversed, it becomes "9 3".
- 123456: The digits are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. When reversed, it becomes "6 5 4 3 2 1".
- 1200: The digits are 1, 2, 0, and 0. When reversed, it becomes "0 0 2 1".

### Constraints
- 1 ≤ \( T \) ≤ 10
- 0 ≤ \( N \) ≤ \( 10^9 \)
